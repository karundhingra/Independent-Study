With the idea of audio signal processing from the point of view of clustering and classification, 
I have designed this report for using a IEEE audio signal dataset and some noise to extend it to a mixed signal dataset for trying out 
algorithms like K Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (for clustering) and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier to train these signals.
I have kept the scope as for the level of SNR as my label for classification. Effective classification and classification is observed
using PCA.
